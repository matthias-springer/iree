# Build only the IREE runtime using CMake
#
# Designed for CI, but can be run locally. The desired build directory can be
# passed as the first argument. Otherwise, it uses the environment variable
# IREE_RUNTIME_BUILD_DIR, defaulting to "build-runtime". It reuses the build
# directory if it already exists. Expects to be run from the root of the IREE
# repository.
